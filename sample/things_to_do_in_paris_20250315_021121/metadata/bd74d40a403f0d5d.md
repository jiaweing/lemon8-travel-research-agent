# Quarter-life crisis? Burnt out? You‚Äôre not alone ‚ú®
Was reminiscing my crew days and thought to pen down my thoughts on burnt out. Long post ahead :‚Äô) 
Quarter-life crisis is real. 
That moment when you graduated from University and started your first job, be prepared to be hit with a sudden realisation that your life is no longer planned out for you. You have followed the systems of traditional education and now, what‚Äôs next? 
After working for 2-3 years, I was completely burnt out by the time I hit 25. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWow I‚Äôm so tired after 2-3 years, I really cannot imagine doing this for the next 20-30 years ü´†‚Äù. The urge of rage quitting is real, and as it‚Äôs not an uncommon mantra to just quit without a plan to heal first and worry later, I was very close to doing just that. 
But my rational side got the better of me, and I find myself wondering whether there are alternatives to consider while still address the root issue of why I‚Äôm feeling what I was feeling. It took me a long time to word out my emotions as the process of unearthing my frustrations at work/life requires me to be intentional and honest with myself. If you are feeling the same way, I promise you that any hard work that enables you to know yourself better is worth the effort!
‚ú® Here are some questions that I asked myself when deciding what‚Äôs my next step: 
1) If I dig deeper, what is the real reason I felt miserable at work? 
As I was formally in the healthcare/social sector, it unfortunately requires a high amount of OT which gradually got to me. I felt that I have no time of my own for hobbies and self-discovery, and often have no energy left (would just want to sleep and not do anything). After awhile, I have no idea who I was anymore. That resulted in me not being able to give to others, because no one could give from an empty cup. 
2) If I have all the free time, do I have a plan on how to use it wisely? What are some of the things I would like to do? 
It was clear to me that I love traveling and would often dream about exploring new cities. Beyond just the ig worthy pics, travelling have taught me so much about myself. I thought about going on solo trips if I have the time, but long trips require more $ and I might not be able to afford the luxury. 
Another thing I would like to do is to have the space to figure out what I would to do long term, as I was quite sure that I would not be going back to my previous role. I realised that I‚Äôm not tired of working in general, just that my current role does not serve me anymore. 
3) Can I still be employed and do the things I mentioned under qns 2)? 
I figured that if travelling and exploring new places around the world was one of my main priorities, I might be able to fulfil this dream while still being employed - and SIA was massively hiring cabin crew then as well which seems to fit the bill. So I took the leap of faith and got hired ‚úàÔ∏è
‚ú® How being a Cabin Crew helped me to heal: 
Now, this phase of my life felt like a lifetime ago :‚Äô) but still looking back, I was glad I went ahead. 
Imagine having scones & tea in London one day, to snorkelling in your Maldives resort the other, then back to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower / have some hot chocolate, and suddenly you are shopping in Tokyo‚Äôs Donki the next - the list goes on. 
My batchmates were mostly younger than me, and to most this was their first full-time job. I understand why the hierarchical environment may cause one to hate the job, but it didn‚Äôt really bothered me because I was completely basking in bliss because now I have so much more free time and work life balance - it was heaven compared to my previous role! So crew gossips/nasty crew etc just kinda passed me (I couldn‚Äôt care less üòõ)
Of course, it comes with its own set of challenges such as the constant jet lag due to red eye flights and irregular sleep patterns, which might cause health issues in the long run. I know it won‚Äôt be a job that I would want to do till I retire, simply because I am not sure how much more stress my body could take. I just know that since I‚Äôm still young, this would be the best and only time to experience this lifestyle. 
‚ú® Conclusion: 
Everyone‚Äôs interests and dreams differ, hence being a Cabin Crew might not work for you as well. 
For example: 
- If you are someone who loves fitness, you might want to explore learning/studying to become a PT, or a Spin/Pilates/Yoga instructor. 
- If you are someone who loves photography, you might want to try out shoot gigs/start a YouTube or TikTok account. 
- If you are someone that grew bored of your work is interested in a new domain, you might want to pursue post Grad/Masters/etc.
That being said, full respect to people who have assessed their capacity and decide to quit without any plans. Sometimes, just resting might be just what you need and it is important for us to give our body the rest it deserves too. 
Hope this post finds the right people, who might be going through something similar. May my story lend you some comfort in life - it‚Äôs rly ok to not know what‚Äôs next üí≠

Im going thru the same as you!!! ü•∫‚ú® and still feeling really lost with whats the next phrase of my life gonna be.. enjoy the free time you‚Äôve now before diving into a new role. Sometimes a career break gives you a better mindset to decide what is best for you and what isnt. ü•∞

Fellow ESFP ‚ú® I had a burnout at 29 too, and my bday gift to myself was to take a career break to travel the world. 7mths later and recharged, I went back to working in the same industry but an entirely different role - no regrets at all so I get chu! Some things we have to do for ourselves, bc no one else would üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
