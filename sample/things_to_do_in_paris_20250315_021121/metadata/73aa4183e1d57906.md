# How much to budget for your Europe Trip
Travelling to somewhere in Europe has always been my dream, but its a really expensive one😅 My posts covers what I spent in Switzerland & Paris. Switzerland is known to be expensive so it may not apply to the rest of the European countries. I took some inspiration from Jeslyn's post on Lemon8! 
I broke down the total cost into two ; pre-departure & expenses there. The pre-departure expenses are accurate amounts as I had time to gather reciepts for every amount. The expenses there are an estimated round up! 
Pre Departure: $3.2k 
This amount doesnt include the air ticket as mine was redeemed with miles. It costs roughly 123,000 miles for SQ business, economy would cost roughly 78,000. At the time of purchase (June 2022), economy tickets were about $2.5k++ one way. So you can add roughly $4-5k more for flight tickets, which will bring the sum to $7-8k😩 
I only exchange a total of $1k SGD into Euro & CHF. I didnt wanna carry much cash so I topped up my Youtrip whenever I had to. 
Swiss/Paris Expenses: $8.2k
I did a number of luxury purchases in Paris thats why the amount is high, i got a Mini Lady Dior which was est SGD6k & the rest where food & smaller purchases. There are outlet malls in Paris where you can get cheaper items too! i didnt shop in Switzerland as I knew what I wanted would be available in Paris. 
The $200 transport expenses were all in Switzerland. The STP usually covers 50% for chair lifts & cable cars, some of these rides are about CHF 11-30 (SGD15-40) which is reasonable but Mount Titlis was SG70🙃 
Food amount includes both countries but switzerland was the main cause of the amount being so high.. one meal there would easily cost SGD55per person & thats at regular restaurants, not the fancy ones🥲 We had b/f at the hotels so the $900 would be for lunch & dinner. 
Cost of food in Paris is similar to how cafes in SG charges, each meal should cost about SGD30-40. 
If you plan on travelling to Switzerland/Paris, I hope this post helps! I always emphasize on saving on accoms so book early! HSBC credit card holders get 5% off worldwide bookings on Agoda. You can also find a friend/relative who are Gold Members on booking sites for discounts 💳
Things like travel insurance are also always on discounts so keep a close lookout👀 
There are a couple of ways to save on air ticket as well, you can accumulate miles, book early, or fly budget! But not every budget airline travels far so you might have to transfer. You can read my post on how to accumulate miles with credit cards [here ](https://www.lemon8-app.com/@_isabelchan/7214098123759649282?region=sg)👍🏻
