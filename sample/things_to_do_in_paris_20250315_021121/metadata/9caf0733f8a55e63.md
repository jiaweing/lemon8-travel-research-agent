# why madrid is the best city for exchange
i went on exchange to madrid from aug 2022 - jan 2023 and it’s the best decision i’ve made in my life despite the huge hole in my pocket 🤧
i spent about 15k+ on my entire exchange, visiting 16 cities but madrid has my heart ❤️
cost💰
spain is pretty affordable compared to other big european cities like paris, london, amsterdam etc. i can confidently say that spain is one of the best countries i’ve been to in terms of what it offers and its price point. firstly, its shopping… oof definitely the best bc you’ll never find zara, stradivarius, p&b, bershka etc. at such low prices anywhere else 🤑🤑 you can get Zara jeans for $40 or lower in comparison to $70 and above in sg 😰
secondly, their public transport is really affordable and efficient!! with their student card, you only pay 10 euros a month for unlimited travel on the public transport 🤪 
safety 🫶🏻
i felt really comfortable exploring the city myself and never felt out of place. you don’t really get stared at or feel like you’re gonna get robbed like what most would think :”) and tbh most people are really friendly and i was also really lucky to meet some very kind people. there was once i actually lost my phone and revolut card but someone went out of his way to return it to me 😭🙏🏻
nightlife 💃🏻
ofc you can’t leave spain without experiencing their nightlife :”) clubs are open everyday 🫨 i’m not an experienced clubber but i went several times and can confidently say there hasn’t been a single occasion where the music and vibes weren’t 10/10 🤩 
if you’re here, def check out fking monday (only opened on mondays but it’s really interesting bc they always have themed nights!), kapital (biggest club in madrid with 7 levels) and teatro magno (pretty cool interior). 
it’s also really cheap to get a table unlike in sg, in fact it’s more worth to get the table if you have a group bc you get drinks as well, for the same price as when you buy them individually. tickets are usually around 15 euros but there are nights where it’s free to enter if you keep a lookout for it!
travelling ✈️
one great thing about spain is that it’s really big so you can travel to many places without taking the plane! you can do day trips to toledo and segovia from madrid too as they’re only 1h~ away! if you’re there, barcelona, mallorca, ibiza, valencia, malaga, canary islands and seville are worth a visit even though you don’t hear about them much! i didn’t get to visit all of the places mentioned even though I wanted to but i’ve heard really good things about them and i really want to go back someday 😩 
besides travelling around spain, it’s near morocco (highly recommend to go!!!) and portugal too which makes for affordable and quick semester trips!! 
some cons 👎🏻
⚪️ not many locals can speak english compared to the other parts of europe and they speak really fast and can be a bit impatient at times but i’ve never had any bad experiences so I think it’s still not a major concern!! google translate will be ur bestie 😆
⚪️ spain is not central so it’ll be a little more ex/ takes longer to get to places in eastern durope or UK but if you plan your trips in advance you can easily find cheap flights regardless bc that’s what i did and paid really affordable prices for my trips!
⚪️ there are no beaches in madrid so you have to travel out to barcelona, valencia, bilbao etc. if you want to visit the beach 🥲
tbh i had a hard time recalling cons about madrid bc i really enjoyed my time there, so if you’re not sure where to go for exchange, i’ll definitely recommend Madrid with my whole heart 🫶🏻 you wouldn’t regret it!

may I ask if you’re familiar of storage lockers to store luggages in Barcelona while traveling to other cities temporarily?
