# i spend SO MUCH MORE $$$ on travelling now ü•≤
I was thinking about this the other day, and I realised it‚Äôs SO DIFFERENT travelling in your 20s vs 30s. 
Here are some of my personal reflections! 
When I was in my early 20s, I obviously had a lot less money to spend on travelling. 
I took one of the biggest trips (my 2-month trip around Europe) right after I graduated, so I really had to scrimp and save throughout the entire trip. 
What I did: 
‚úîÔ∏è Backpacked with the bare essentials (and also brought washing powder to wash my clothes throughout the trip) 
‚úîÔ∏è Spent the night at airports whenever I had an early flight, in order to save money on accom 
‚úîÔ∏è Couchsurfed at strangers‚Äô houses (and basically crashed on their couches) to save money on hotels 
‚úîÔ∏è Bought pre-made food from supermarkets and ate at parks instead of eating at restaurants/eateries 
This is a really hardcore way of travelling, but I honestly enjoyed it and made so many incredible memories. 
With Couchsurfing, especially... you meet so many people of all walks of life, and you really get to understand a country through the lens of a local. 
But now that I'm in my 30s, the way I travel is vastly different. 
Firstly, I now stay at hotels, and preferably nice-ish hotels that are in good condition (well maintained, not dirty or worn out, etc). 
I also take advantage of credit card miles to get better flights (this depends on how much you spend, obviously, but if you‚Äôre paying for any big ticket items like your first home/wedding/etc, you can easily accumulate a lot of miles that can fund your next plane ticket!) 
When it comes to meals, I still really enjoy having cheap & good local food (like street food and/or affordable eateries), but I now splurge on one ‚Äúfancy‚Äù meal per trip. 
In short, the way I travel now is a lot more comfortable (and expensive) compared to before ü•≤
Now that I‚Äôm older and I have limited time and energy, it makes more sense to spend on certain things (for example, making sure I have decent accomm so that I can be comfortable and well-rested, and have more energy to enjoy my trip). 
That said, I do have very fond memories of travelling on a tight budget, and I‚Äôm so glad I have those experiences from my early 20s. I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for the world :‚Äô) 
Do you guys feel the same way about travelling? Are you in your travel-on-a-budget era or are you happy to spend more on your travelling? ü•∞

same here! in my 30s and they say 30s (before kids) is like your 20s but with more $$$ haha I've been indulging in a more luxurious and comfortable travel experience lately! I even try hard not to take budget airlines as much as possible these days (it's so common in my 20s, almost a no brainier)

so true! I used to be a hardcore budget traveller when I was in my 20s. but priorities have changed and time is more precious now - renting a car, taking a better transport option (eg taxi, long distance train vs overnight bus) makes so much more sense than dying the next day üòÇ
