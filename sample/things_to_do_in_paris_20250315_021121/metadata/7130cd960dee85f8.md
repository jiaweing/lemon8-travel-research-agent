# PARIS: HONEST THOUGHTS 🇫🇷👀
hola i came back from a paris trip at the start of feb, and here are my HONEST thoughts about the city!
i’ve been to paris before, and i thought it was aite. wanted to see if much has changed!
✅ THE LOUVRE IS GORGEOUS
- we managed to enter the louvre for free (only on the first friday of the month)! it was truly breathtaking. i would totally pay to go in tbh
- i wouldn’t mind spending the whole day inside. lots of amazing artwork that just blow your mind
- i know people say the mona lisa is underwhelming.. but ngl i was surprisingly happy to see such a famous painting. defo worth a visit
✅ FOOD CAN BE BUSSIN
- when the food is good… it’s really good ngl
- tried quite a few delicious pastries, some notable ones include The French Bastards and Union Boulangerie
- had the most buss truffle pasta at Pink Mamma (though i would love to visit italy and compare)
✅ EIFFEL TOWER IS WORTH THE HYPE
- super duper mesmerising. especially when it sparkles
- definitely a sight to behold!!! 
✅ LOVELY STREETS
- paris is quite a nice place to wander around. my friends and i landed around 12pm the first day, and we just hung around the city centre before meeting our other friends, and it was super chill and cosy!
- very pretty streets, really feeling that emily in paris vibe
❌ PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS EX
- dude i thought london was bad. paris is equally horrible (& personally i find it less enjoyable than london)
- every one way ride is like €2.50? AND super dumb thing is that even though you can use the paris transport app on your phone to pay for the metro, if you want to buy a ticket on the train to the airport, you can’t use the same device. so i had to buy the physical card anyway
- ya and NO CONTACTLESS CARD YA. you need to use their transport card system
- but it is easy to navigate! just doesn’t feel super safe tbh there’s people who try to squeeze with you through the gates so that they don’t have to pay
❌ FOOD AIN’T ALWAYS BUSS
- most of the good food i had were really on the higher end of prices…
- the japanese food pictured was one of the cheapest meals we ate.. and it was still above €10!!! so tough out here for the foodies
⭐️ WORTH OR NAH? 
- i think paris is worth ONE VISIT. that’s all HAHA overall the vibes can be very nice and pretty, but i just don’t feel a very strong connection to the city
- as a major foodie as well, i must say i was generally disappointed 😅 french cuisine isn’t on top
- also like it just feels quite shady in general? like even though im with my friends i don’t feel very safe either HAHA especially when walking further out of the city centre
ok that’s all! look forward to more travel content coming up LOL
