# PARIS 101: ULTIMATE guide (food, tips & reviews) ‚úàÔ∏è
hello zesties üçã 
i went to paris 3x over my exchange, and even watched a concert in paris so i‚Äôm deffo qualified to write this guide üòé anw save this if you‚Äôre planning to go or u intend on visiting paris someday bc i promise this is useful info you‚Äôll wanna know! 
for guides to other countries & cities in europe, check out [#sarahineurope](https://www.lemon8-app.com/topic/7411587739516452881?region=sg), i visited 24 countries so you‚Äôll find something for you!
firstly, paris is the most dangerous place i visited in europe, i got [stalked](https://www.lemon8-app.com/@ssarahbarah/7430018065951162881?region=sg) (even with male friends) so please keep yourself & your belongings safe w some [tips](https://www.lemon8-app.com/@ssarahbarah/7430018065951162881?region=sg) (don‚Äôt be out too late PLEASE, come back before 12, and DONT let anyone touch your belongings)
secondly, paris eiffel tower is lit up at night, and the last light show is NOT 1am, don‚Äôt trust online sources cos we were scammed out of a light show. i think last show at 12am!
thirdly, be prepared for racism and rudeness from the locals and service staff, it‚Äôs quite normal here unfortunately :‚Äù
fourthly, paris metro zone system is very very confusing & you don‚Äôt wanna be fined so please familiarise w where you wanna go & the appropriate ticket to buy! (we ran from the conductors here & 2 people of our group got fined so you dont wanna do that üò≠)
lastly, if you want tickets to climb the eiffel tower/arc de triomphe, pls book tickets EARLY!! its possible to queue for museums but queues r hella long like a few hrs so book in adv (esp louvre). if ur a student, museum entry is free BUT you‚Äôll have to wait in line‚Ä¶ i j sucked thumb and booked tix cos i didnt wanna spend the whole day queueing üòµ‚Äçüí´
ok onto my more specific reviews & tips!
ùóîùóßùóßùó•ùóîùóñùóßùóúùó¢ùó°ùó¶!
Tour Saint-Jacques
üóº oklor just a really cool really tall gothic style tower! we didnt go in, we just lookedlooked from outside and took a few pics!
Notre Dame Cathedral:
‚õ™Ô∏è wanted to go inside but couldnt find the entrance so assuming its still entirely undergoing rebuilding from the fire m
‚õ™Ô∏è got platform outside for you to take pics of it though! but abit eyesore cos got all the rebuilding/construction work‚Ä¶ like can see the cranes and all from the platform view
‚õ™Ô∏è we walked further down the river along a random bridge to take from another angle to hide abit of the construction works
Shakespeare & Company Bookstore:
üìö where everyone gets their tote bags from LOLL but it was pricey & iirc the books were also really pricey sadly!
üìö supercute place to visit, but not really to sit and read cos its super duper crowded and the queue to enter is insanely long sia‚Ä¶
üìö my friends random typed poems were really cute and i wldve gotten it because i really appreciate art in words (aka literature‚Ä¶ poems and proses and all hehe) but we both had a hard(er than we thought as lit students) time analysing the poems. was a rly fun activity to do tho! would buy a pack of these if i came back!
Vintage Bookstores by the River Seine:
üìñ idk the proper name for this cos i forgot teehee but it was raining heavily when we went so only a few of them were open! vintage vibesss got like old comic books and also vinyls & old photos/art as well!
Louvre
üî∫pls book in advance if you wanna go in without queueing 5 hours cos it was off peak season and the queue was insane‚Ä¶ we did not book so we did not go in üòÖü§£ took a few pics around the area with the buildings and the iconic Louvre structure!
Jardin des Tuileries
ü™¥ really pretty & big garden near the museums! good to take a stroll/sit around especially if the weather is good but we couldn‚Äôt really appreciate cos it was pretty cold & rainy when we went
Mus√©e de l'Orangerie
üñºÔ∏è as usual, pls book‚Ä¶ queue to go in was pretty long‚Ä¶ went for 1 thing and 1 thing only ‚Äî Claude Monet‚Äôs water lillies! art was pretty and all and it was really crowded (off peak bear in mind‚Ä¶) so couldnt really capture good pics err
üñºÔ∏è i also am not an art person‚Ä¶ im a museum person i cant really appreciate artwork artwork so i was genuinely only there for the famous paintings oops
Arc de Triomphe
üèõÔ∏è theres a little path in between the roads for you to take pics of the arc but as usual it was really crowded and we didnt get a single good pic no matter how close or far we walked from it LOL
üèõÔ∏è did not go in but i wld imagine the view would be nice because it includes paris with the eiffel tower!! but not very tall so idk what views ull actl see LMAO
Champs-√âlys√©es
üõçÔ∏è for rich people‚Ä¶ full of branded shit that we could not afford‚Ä¶ i couldnt even afford going into any store to walk around LOL
üõçÔ∏è only went here when i was with my parents to shop for mid branded stuff (like longchamp) and macarons LMAO
üõçÔ∏è walk around for vibes ig and if you wanna shop luxury goods this is the place to be at!
Jardins du Trocad√©ro
üóº went here for the view of the eiffel tower! u know the usual - too crowded to take good pics LMAO so all our eiffel & us pics had soooo many people in the background LOL
üóº we didnt actually go down to the park‚Ä¶ only stayed at the viewing platform LOL but if you wanna look at the eiffel from bottom up then go down to the park to walk! it wld probably be better in spring than winter LMAO
Mus√©e d'Orsay
üé® went for vincent van gogh my favourite mentally ill artist ‚ù§Ô∏è saw starry nights here and got to appreciate his other artworks (i genuinely like his art style, its so chaotic! & i managed to correctly guess the last painting he did before he committed suicide just cos it was so depressed vibes)
üé® found another artist i liked! edgar degas! really liked his paintings of dancers and the operas and stuff like that
üé® museum was too big i got so bored looking at art‚Ä¶ but ya i really loved learning about van gogh cos im genuinely interested in him & his art!
Eiffel Tower
‚ù§Ô∏è what people come to Paris for! we went up close at night (early night not late night cos UNSAFEE) to see eiffel tower from below! did not stay to watch it sparkle, watched it from other locations listed below
‚ù§Ô∏è did not go up and see cos whats the point‚Ä¶ u see paris w/o the eiffel tower then what for‚Ä¶ 
Montmarte:
üèòÔ∏è really cute neighbourhood, spent half the day walking around and it was so vibey! the architecture through the streets was insaneee
üèòÔ∏è shoptapepitevintage: went to this vintage store but it was so freaking pricey‚Ä¶ has name brand items inside so if you‚Äôre keen on it you can go!
üèòÔ∏è Place √âmile Goudeau: all the famous artists sat in this square before so we also went to sit on a bench in this square LMAO
üèòÔ∏è Place du Tertre: really cool artists here! they do real life portraits and caricatures with charcoal and paints and all and i really wanted to get mine but it was so rainy and i would have no way to get mine home to singapore without crushing it (even if they give the cylindrical tube LMAO)
üèòÔ∏è Place Dalida: Dalida statue‚Ä¶ naked woman! touch her breasts for good luck! im not even joking about it her boobs were a different shade from the rest of her body cos everyone touch LMAO PLS‚Ä¶
üèòÔ∏è Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica: nice church! inside also quite nice! outside got one platform/stairs for people to sit down and enjoy the views of the rest of paris cos montmarte is pretty high (is on a hill) & we watched the sunset while listening to a busker‚Ä¶ my favourite moment in the whole paris trip leh so vibessszzzxcxxx
VIEWPOINTS FOR EIFFEL TOWER:
- Pont De L‚ÄôAlma
- Port Debilly
- Jardins du Trocad√©ro
ùóôùó¢ùó¢ùóó!
Le Petit Bouillon Pharamond
ü•ò my paris exchange friend introduced me to it so FULL TRUST! she said her friend recco-ed it to her keke also the mains are ‚Ç¨10+ which is so so good for french food in paris! i intro-ed it to my friends and i went there another 3x more, so 4x total at this place LMAOO
ü•ò long ass queues, we went 15min before it opened the last time for lunch and there was alr a longass queue‚Ä¶ dinner even worse the first time i waited 1.5h n the queue system damn weird&messy u give ur name first then u wait arnd until they call ur name LOL
ü•ò portion size is just nice, managed to finish n be full enough!
ü•ò bro i have so many things to recco‚Ä¶ ESCARGOT WAS SO GOOD!! for appetisers! and then i really liked the beef tatare as well (raw beef so is rly acquired taste, u might not like it) & the stew was SOOOOOO good oml but the desserts like meh only i think u can go elsewhere for better desserts but dont miss out the mains and the escargot its HEAVENLYYY
ü•ò service either hit or miss, first night they were rude then third time i went server was recommending his fav items and being overall friendly
ü•ò (from my last visit in may) the quality dropped‚Ä¶ it rly doesnt hit the same‚Ä¶ also the duck confit changed style and its rly not mind blowing as it was before so thats sad
Chez Gladines
üçõ the prices are equally friendly!
üçõ got some potato tomato omelette thing & chicken in tomato sauce & rice and omg BOTH were so good but this one the portioning is v big so we couldnt finish‚Ä¶
üçõ i walked past several times and restaurant looks packed but no/little queue so i guess if udw to wait this is the best option HAHAH
üçõ service was good also, the guy was so nice heehee i took a pic of him at the end cos he was so cute
Shakespeare and Company Caf√©
üçµ NAURRRR worst matcha and chai ive ever had in my life‚Ä¶ bookstore nearby is the highlight fr and not the teas‚Ä¶ matcha tasted like WATER n chai tasted like MILK‚Ä¶ we tried to salvage w cinnamon powder n sugar but there was rly no saving it it was THAAAAAT BADDDDD
Bouillon Julien
ü•© meh‚Ä¶ meat was tough and the other dish we got which was some cheese and zucchini i think was rly ntg special‚Ä¶ also cheap(er) food in paris but then it was meh‚Ä¶ n we waited 1h for this üò≠
Carette (Eiffel outlet)
ü•ê go early, queue is superduper long‚Ä¶ heng we went during lull period, only need wait 30min‚Ä¶ its literally tiktok famous and was going viral so ig thats why
ü•ê the wait was more for outside seating so if you wanna sit inside its less waiting time but really the vibes are for outside so just sit outside LOL
ü•ê croissants were BOMBBB u must order it and dip it in ur hot chocolate, and hot chocolate was thick and rich and tasted like straight chocolate!!!! it got gelat after awhile and we alm couldnt finish (thanks ashley for tanking my share) so i wld say 2 can share it! esp if u add whipped cream its such a big serving 2 people can share 1 also LOLL n the whipped cream was so fresh (i ate it on its own also BAHAH)
Carettes (another outlet i forgot oop)
ü•ê wait time at the outlets not as long as the one near the eiffel LOLOL
ü•ê croissants r rly good, and hot chocolate is v gao! as usual very very overwhelming & too gelak, i could not finish üôÉ
La Maison Rose:
üå∏ landmark in montmarte cos of its pink building! really quite cute exterior & small cosy interior
üå∏ but the drinks were pricey & meh‚Ä¶ my friend said her coffee was okay and my homemade vanilla fruit coke or stg was oklor nice but not worth the price HAHAHA ig its more for the vibes‚Ä¶ but outside take pic is gd enough alr tbh HAHAHAHHA
Lou Cantou
üç¥ one of the best foods i had in paris! mid-range prices but really worth the pricing imo! they have certain sets that u can mix n match w soup n dessert n drinks so it was greatt
üç¥ french onion soup, beef stew & escargot especially were BEAUTIFULL
üç¥ cheesecake & creme brulee were really nice too!
La Cre√™perie des Artistes
ü•û low ass ratings on google but we felt like eating a lil snacky snack so we didnt bother and went in
ü•û woman was rude to me, but my parents found her hilarious‚Ä¶
ü•û crepes were rly meh‚Ä¶ not great they tasted like any normal persons crepes let alone FRENCH crepes‚Ä¶ had sets & were ok pricing but rly not worth for the quality, i didnt like it‚Ä¶ my parents thought it was ok tho & were willing to come back so‚Ä¶ but personally for the price, the quality is a NO from me
ü•û not a lot of people in the store too (shdve been our first red flag)
La Petite Bleue Brunch & Coffee

‚òïÔ∏è caramel pancakes & salmon&eggs on toast were BEAUTIFULLY DONE! i rmbr it being super yummy & my parents were also impressed

‚òïÔ∏è they give free water!! infused w mint & lemon its amazing 
‚òïÔ∏è the coffee is good too! i had some rose coffee or smth and it was p sweet and VERY good i was impressed
‚òïÔ∏è would HIGHLYYYY recco u come here if u like brunch/cafes
‚òïÔ∏è prices r a lil on the higher end tho 
La Bistro Marbeuf
üçñ waiter whose fiance was malaysian so he could speak abit of malay & understood singlish & lived in KL so he was accustomed to us and our accent n overall rly friendly rly great he let my dad practice french (most french people will not)
üçñ that waiter was the only good part‚Ä¶ cant rmbr what we had but we collectively agreed it was really meh‚Ä¶ especially for the price bruh‚Ä¶ pls skip this place LOL
üçñ escargot v hard to come out (think is not fresh..)
Linette
üçΩÔ∏è beautiful food! it was reallll good & close to the eiffel tower & the street everyone takes photos w the eiffel so u can see photoshoots gg on outside HAHAHA
üçΩÔ∏è ordered some seafood risotto (oops not french) but it was really good, and then i tried foie gras for the first time but i didnt like it, my parents said it was good tho! duck confit was wonderful also, skin was crispy and inside was soft and tender! french onion soup was delicious, i think the best one i had in paris! escargot was really good too!
Dalloyau
ü´ñ had it as the last teabreak before me & my parents left‚Ä¶ it was Expensive‚Ä¶ and the service was rly horrible, they deadass ignored us and took forever to prepare bc they just chatted amongst themselves so we waited q a bit, then they scolded us for sitting at the table‚Ä¶
ü´ñ food was ok lar, macarons weren‚Äôt as good as the typical pierre hermes or laduree
ü´ñ hot chocolate was good but godiva in belgium still slaps more
Ladure√©
üíï expensive af macarons but u can buy individuals to try! really yummy (i do like pierre herm√© better tho!)
Pierre Herm√©
‚ô•Ô∏è the better of the quality macarons that ive tried! i prefer this to la duree but it is a tad bit more expensive than la duree‚Ä¶
Chez Gaston
üçπ the viral brunch place on tiktok! the sets were cheappp and like 2 of us shared 1 set & i found it filling so that was GREAT! (comes w 1 sweet 1 savoury food, 1 juice 1 coffee)
üçπ the food was slightly above average, ntg to rly crow about but it was great for the price!
üçπ they dont take reservations (we thought we did) so take note u cant reserve & if u r reserving ur probably doing it for the wrong restaurant OOPS
üçπ decor was rly pretty! very flowery
üçπ waitstaff was q racist & purposely ignored us but paid attn to other white people so‚Ä¶ tried to scam us also (either intentionally or not idk but didnt return us the right amt of change)
La F√™te du Pain
ü•ñ AMAZING breads! pain au chocolat & croissant were sooo flaky and buttery & delicious. price was also pretty good, under ‚Ç¨2 for 1 big piece iirc!
ü•ñ so lucky we were there during that time! got to watch pastry chefs make them & also compete for best breads (designs were soo freaking cool)
Go Oun
üçú korean food. and sooo delicious (so expensive tho wth‚Ä¶), we tried tteokbokki and kimchi jigae were SO GOOD!! real yummy i really liked it!! bingsuu was too icy and not milky (no condensed milk to pour over also <\3) but still not too bad! 
okie that is all i hope you enjoy paris! (i hated every second being there ‚ô•Ô∏è)
