# Top 5 locations to visit coming from a Cabin Crew
Planning to travel soon? I‚Äôve been to a few countries as a cabin crew, people always ask me ‚ÄúWhich is your favourite country to go?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere do you recommend to visit?‚Äù. Alright, here are my recommendations if you‚Äôre planning for an holiday! 
üá®üá≠Switzerland
üí∞: $$$$$ (very expensive)
As a Singaporean, I think Switzerland is the best place to go to escape life. When I was there, I really felt like I am in another Universe where I have no work stress, work obligations or any worries. You need to check out the Swiss Alps, I‚Äôve only been to Mt Titlis. I would recommend you to go during winter where the lake is frozen and they open it for ice skating. You also get to go for tube sliding. I went in August this year, it‚Äôs a different vibe. The mountain top is still cold but at the bottom, the lake is open for kayaking and the zip line is open. 
üá´üá∑ France
üí∞: $$$$
There‚Äôs actually a lot of things to do in France. I‚Äôve been to Paris mostly but in Paris itself, there are countless of Museums, Disneyland and also the Eiffel Tower to check out. You need to have dinner by the Eiffel Tower in the Seine River. It is so beautiful and with the right weather, it‚Äôs the perfect date you can bring your partner to. You can also visit the castles and wineries out of Paris, they will take your breath away! If you‚Äôre into luxury shopping then France is the place to go! You can get the best savings out of your purchases. Can I also recommend you guys to try their Garlic Soup, any store anywhere it is super good! Eat it with bread!
üáÆüáπ Italy
üí∞: $$$
Home of the Roman Empire, if you have an interest in their ancient history you need to visit Italy. You will be in awe of the remains of what was once so grand and spectacular. You might want to avoid going during summer, the weather can be scorching hot and very dry. You need to visit Venice, other than the fact that it is low-key drowning. The whole city can be quite difficult to manoeuvre since it‚Äôs linked mainly by bridges. You can also visit the smaller islands which are less crowded. Oh you need to go Cinque Terre! It is so beautiful and being in the sea or just standing at the balcony is the best feeling in the world!! 
üáØüáµ Japan
üí∞: $$$ (can be subjective depends on what you‚Äôre planning to do)
I love Japan! Shopping, Culture, Sightseeing they have it all and they have RICE! As an Asian, I love my Asian food so European food can be a bit meh for me. You should know this but Tokyo is more for modern activities and Osaka focuses more on food and culture. Near Osaka, you can also visit Nara Park and Kyoto for sightseeing. 
üáπüá≠ Thailand
üí∞: $
I said I love Japan right‚Ä¶ Thailand has my heart! I LOVE THAILAND EVEN MORE! I think it‚Äôs the people there. They are very welcoming, kind and they don‚Äôt discriminate at all. You don‚Äôt get any form of discrimination or prejudice at all. The food there is amazing too!!!
