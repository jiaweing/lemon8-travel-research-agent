# I went to London and Paris alone üò≥ part 1
I just came back from my first solo trip to London and Paris for 11 days. Traveling solo was such an adventure! It was an impromptu trip, so I didn‚Äôt have much time to plan and was a bit nervous because I had not travelled to these countries before. But it turned out to be an amazing experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.
I‚Äôll be sharing about my experience in London in this post. I‚Äôll share more about Paris in part 2! 
Safety üîê 
London, surprisingly, had me feeling more alert and cautious compared to Paris. As an Asian woman in Europe, you automatically draw attention. However I always put on a good RBF and walk with confident to avoid being targeted. Plus, knowing there's no tax refund in London, I refrained from splurging on luxury items, which eased concerns about potential theft üò≥
Accommodation üè† 
I stayed in a hotel in Paris and two different hostels in London. I‚Äôll share more about them in another post. Always choose a place within a 5-minute walk from any public transport‚Äîyou won‚Äôt want to be walking too far back to your hostel when it‚Äôs dark. I met a fellow female traveler in my hostel, and we ended up exploring the city together. I‚Äôm so glad I picked up the courage to start a conversation with a stranger!
Transport üöä 
Public transport is super convenient, but those stairs are brutal if you‚Äôre carrying heavy luggage. Other than that, getting around was pretty easy once I got the hang of it. In London, all you need is Google Maps and your phone. No more fumbling with cards or paper tickets‚Äîjust tap your mobile wallet like back in SG, and you're good to go! Fare usually comes up to ¬£2.70 per trip within the city, as indicated by Google Maps.
Sightseeing üëÄ
London is packed with things to see and do. While I found it incredibly walkable, I wouldn't recommend it for elderly travelers. Many attractions, like the National Gallery and Natural History Museum were free and you could pre-book on their website to skip the queue! I felt 6 days wasn‚Äôt enough to cover London. My favorites were the weekend markets at Brick Lane and Spitalfields. Luckily, my friend told me about them on a Sunday, so I managed to visit before I left.
Food ü•ê
Ah, London cuisine! Let's just say dining out could easily set you back ¬£20-30 at a restaurant. I‚Äôm not really picky when it comes to food while traveling, so I don‚Äôt have much to comment on. However, I made sure to try fish and chips recommended by a friend who‚Äôs been living there for a few years. It didn‚Äôt disappoint! To save costs (and leave room for more shopping!), I opted for ready meals from Tesco on some days. 
‚ú® Overall ‚ú®
Being alone gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. If you‚Äôre considering a solo trip to London, go for it! The city is vibrant and full of surprises, perfect for a solo adventure. I can‚Äôt wait to share more about my journey in my next posts!
