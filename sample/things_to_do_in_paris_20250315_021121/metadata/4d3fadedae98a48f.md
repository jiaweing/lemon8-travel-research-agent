# #TRAVEL | 5 Days in Paris🥐
The city of love😍❤️ finally going to Paris, its one of the cities on my bucketlist & im superr excited💕 Paris is full of iconic landmarks, cafes & restaurants that are super worth visiting. The architecture is sooo beautiful. The public transport is slightly more expensive than SG's (excluding taxis). Dining out is a slight bit pricier as well but their restaurants offers fabulous views , ambience & some are even known for their live performances. Some restaurants are even booked out for 2-3 months straight🥲 
Its my first time in Paris & I only have 4 days, I will be covering the main attractions in the city , will be giving Disneyland a miss this time🥹 
Day 1 (Arr at 1:40pm) 
- Eiffel Tower
- Arc de Triomphe
- Dinner at Pizzaria Popolare (Highly recommend you to reserve) 
I will be arriving in the afternoon so I will only start exploring the city around 3 after checking in. Will be heading to see the Iron Lady first as its just a short walk away from my hotel. I've also planned on going around the nearby streets where you can get better shots of the tower. I won't be going up the Eiffel tower or on the Arc de Triomphe as I feel like just seeing it would be sufficient & I really want to spend my time exploring or shopping instead! I also made a reservation at one of Big Mamma's restaurants, Pizzaria Popolare. 
Day 2 
- Carette
- Shop at La Vallee Village 
- Hunt Emily in Paris spots 
- Dinner at Terra Nerra 
I usually take at least 1/2 a day at outlets which is why this is the only thing planned. La Vallee is a big outlet district with many brands , its less than an hour away from the city. A few friends mentioned that Terra Nerra (Gabriel's restaurant) is really good + affordable so why not! Since most emily in paris locations are around the area, i'll be trying to spot them😅
Day 3 
- Saint Chapelle
- Maison Savauge Saint German Cafe
- Galaries Lafayette
If you know me, I'm definitely not leaving Paris without any bags😂 Galaries Lafayette is a huge departmental store that carries many luxury brands. Its a better option as you can shop the diff brands in one place rather than going boutique to boutique. Its also likely that there will be more stocks for Chanel/Hermes which are my main goals😂❤️
Day 4 
- Cafe de Flore
- Louvre 
Most people said that 1 day isnt enough at the Louvre because its sooo big, so I didnt plan anything else yet. If i do decide to leave the lourve early, it would probably bcoz i wanna shop more & by thn I'll already know where I would wanna return to. 
Drop some of your fave dining places, scenic spots or activities!! 🇫🇷
