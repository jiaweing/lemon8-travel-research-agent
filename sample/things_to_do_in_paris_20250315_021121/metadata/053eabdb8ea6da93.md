# MUST 👀: MOST COMPREHENSIVE guide sapa-hanoi bus!👇
Heyoooo! I got the perfect ultimate guide for you if you're planning to take the overnight bus from Hanoi to Sapa. Trust me you need this for a smooth and enjoyable journey so be prepared to SAVE THIS!! 🌙🌄👇
📚 𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙠:
When I was planning my trip, I read countless reviews including lemon8 and finally decided to book the Saoviet overnight bus! Trust me, it's worth it! At just $34.10 for a round trip on their VVIP bus, it's an affordable and comfortable option. To book, simply search "Sapa overnight bus" on Google, and you'll find options like Bookaway. I chose [BookAway ](https://www.lemon8-app.com/@xinyicarat/7247440269900120577?region=sg)because it was incredibly easy and hassle-free. Just select your date, preferred timing, and pick-up/drop-off locations. Within an hour, they'll send you a confirmation email that serves as your ticket. Payment is straightforward through your card, and I recommend using Youtrip for a slightly better rate without any service charge!
🚍 𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝘽𝙤𝙖𝙧𝙙:
Make sure to choose a📍pick-up location close to your hotel. I opted for the office at the old quarters, which was only a 5-minute walk from my hotel. To ensure a smooth boarding process, arrive at least 45 minutes early. This will give you enough time to collect your ticket and even use the office restroom (though I must admit, it's not the cleanest). Unfortunately, you can't select your seat, but if you prefer privacy, you can ask for the upper deck. If you're traveling with older family members or friends who might have difficulty climbing, the lower deck is a better option. Arriving early might increase your chances of getting your preferred seat, so keep that in mind!
🚌 𝙊𝙣𝙗𝙤𝙖𝙧𝙙 𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚:
I had a fantastic experience on the sleeper bus to Sapa. It was one of their newer buses, and everything was clean and well-maintained. Don't forget to pack a jacket because the bus can get quite cold at night. What I loved most was the onboard toilet, which was a blessing during the long journey. The buttons to flush and use the tap were conveniently located at the sink. Depending on your bus, they may even provide slippers for use in the toilet. And the bus came with some great amenities like USB plugs, privacy curtains, adjustable beds and lights, and even Wi-Fi (although it didn't work on our way there, it worked perfectly on the return journey).
🔍 𝙏𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙩𝙤 𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚:
1️⃣When boarding, you'll be asked to remove your shoes. Don't worry; they provide plastic bags to keep them in. 
2️⃣Also, remember that outside food is not allowed on the bus. They have a designated box at the entrance where you can leave your snacks or meals. 
3️⃣Unfortunately, our return bus wasn't as good as the one we took to Sapa. It was an older bus and looked a bit dirtier, but it did have a massage option, which was a nice touch. If you're taking a morning or afternoon bus for the return trip, they will make a stop at a rest area. You can use the restroom and grab some food there. They provide slippers, so you don't have to put your shoes back on right away.
🛑 𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙆𝙣𝙤𝙬 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙥:
The bus makes several stops along the way, but don't worry about missing yours. The staff is really helpful and will wake you up when you've reached your destination. However, to be extra sure, I recommend checking the estimated arrival time and tracking it on Google Maps.
🚐 𝙎𝙚𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙩 𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙘𝙚: 𝙁𝙧𝙚𝙚 𝙝𝙤𝙩𝙚𝙡 𝙨𝙝𝙪𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚!
When you arrive in Sapa on the night bus, you'll actually reach early. Here's the hidden gem not many know!!: The Sao Viet office offers a free shuttle bus service to your hotel if it's within a 2km radius! Once you disembark in Sapa, you'll encounter a group of taxi drivers eagerly vying for your attention. My advice? Ignore them, as they have a tendency to overcharge. Instead, be on the lookout for a small van with the Saoviet logo. Hop on board, inform the driver of your hotel name and location, and enjoy the free ride to your accommodation!
And there you have it, a comprehensive guide to taking the sleeper bus from Hanoi to Sapa. I hope this information proves helpful to you! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help! Safe travels! ✨🚌
