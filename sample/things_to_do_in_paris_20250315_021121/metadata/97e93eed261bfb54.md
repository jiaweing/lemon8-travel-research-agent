# MUST visit spots for first timers in Paris 🇫🇷✨🤍
1️⃣ breakfast at Carette with hot chocolate & pastries 🍫☕️
hot chocolate was soo good in the cold but pastries were mid, see my review here: [trying the viral Carette hot chocolate in Paris 🇫🇷☕️🍫](https://www.lemon8-app.com/@ntyourbbg/7450061994008281608?region=sg)
2️⃣ take photos with luxury christmas decor 📸✨
📍 DIOR Paris 30 Montaigne
📍 Rue Saint-Honoré
stunning christmas decorations!!! no more explanation needed 🎄🫶🏻
3️⃣ luxury shopping at Champ Élysées 🛍️
are u rly asian if you go to europe and don’t buy luxury goods back??? u save so much compared to sg 🤭 wonder how much you will save? [i saved ~2k by luxury shopping in Paris 💰💰💰](https://www.lemon8-app.com/@ntyourbbg/7450061994008281608?region=sg)
4️⃣ shopping at Le Marais 🛒
the it girl soho area of Paris with artisan bakeries, cafes, and many local shops 🩷
5️⃣ Visit the Eiffel tower ✨
sparkle starts every hour from 8pm to 1am, super pretty and a must visit whenever im in town 🤞🏻
6️⃣ go for a christmas market🎄🎅🏻
📍 Tuileries Garden Christmas Market
if you come here you MUST go on the giant swing (€10) - it gives you a 360 view of the whole night market and you can even see the Eiffel tower hehehe, ++ lots of fair food (raclette, mulled wine, crepes, sausages) and local booths
