# Experience with France Paris Bridal 
If you’re attending a wedding fair soon… you’ll probably see this bridal studio! Sharing our experience thus far since this studio doesn’t have a strong online presence! Hope this helps you couples out there searching for a suitable studio for your PWS/AD! ✨
• Price: we were given huge discounts against their price list and had to decide on the spot 😂 we signed more than 1 package so we still spent quite a bit sobs 
Tip: unless you’ve researched about the studio & know it has what you’re looking for, best advise not to make a decision just yet 
• Communication: via WhatsApp but do expect delay in replies. Longest we’ve waited for a reply was 4 days iirc. It might be “ok what” for most ppl but it was a really simple query and subsequently there wasn’t an explanation as to why the reply took so long… not sure if this means anything to you guys but for your noting haha
• Appointments: need to have the dates kinda fixed before they’ll arrange an appointment for you so this is unlike other studios. If your date is still far, iirc, you don’t get to set appt anytime soon but only closer to your date. We could only make it after work on weekdays and on the weekends.. so iirc, we had to make our appt a month in advance. Oh and they track appt on paper so there wont be email reminders etc but via WhatsApp. 
• Gown selection: styles of their gowns are unlike those that you’ll see in TGW/BY. PWS gown selection is limited to the older collections and this wasn’t shared upfront when signing up 🥲 
Tip: tryna nego for your gown selection to include the ones for AD.. they’re said to be newer and I supposed more trendy haha 
• Suit selection: wide range of colours to choose from but don’t expect good quality. I’m not very sure what makes a good suit but the material is rather flimsy(?) and buttons are those plasticky kind haha
• Service quality: hmm not sure where we stand on this one. It was a comfortable experience trying on the gowns and suits as the reps are very experienced and fast. They also share things to note of and assist w queries in a friendly manner. But while they speak in a friendly tone, at times they’ll include remarks that are unnecessary or hints at you being “troublesome” which make the entire experience rly upsetting 🥹 not sure if I’m using this correctly but in mandarin would 话中带刺 😂
// for instance, I was commented to be “picky” because I took awhile to decide on the gowns.. 🥲 it had me doubting if I was being indecisive (and hence difficult) but I showed my peers and they can’t find anything suitable too 😢 on another instance, when I was asked if I’ve confirmed my choices for which I replied “I’ll see them again today & confirm”, it was responded with a sigh?!?! I can uds the frustration the rep has to deal w on a daily basis but to be fair, I only said to look and not try-on & again to be fairer, even if I want to try again, isn’t gown fitting a part of the package so imo these responses were so uncalled for… 😭
Tip: the sales rep we signed the package w was rly friendly but it’s impt to check who will be handling your package before signing up!
What we wished we did before signing up:
• research about the studio
• asked for more gown/suit catalogue to assess if they’re what we like
• not be lured by package discount or perhaps go with one package eg PWS first
• compare the cost against ala carte rentals for the most VFM decision
The above are my personal recounts and opinions so they are not representative of the lot. All the best in finding the studio that suits you and your S/O best 💕

so far I've only read less than positive reviews on them. don't doubt yourself; their attitude towards you sound bad. it's a vendor I would actively avoid during fairs because of their hardselling 😂

They forced us to sign on the spot but we kept saying no and they couldn't do anything. After we walked away (on the account that we would come back if we wanted to sign), we searched the reviews & it was all bad. the 话中带刺 is so true. they started saying i'm a meatier girl & my fiance is more pretty than me??? mad
