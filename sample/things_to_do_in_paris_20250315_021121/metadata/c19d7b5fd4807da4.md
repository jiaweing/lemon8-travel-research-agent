# Our Honeymoon Itinerary 2024
Hello zesties ! Recently we just came back from our honeymoon trip to Paris and Switzerland. It was our first time visiting these two countries and we enjoyed every moment of it. Here’s our itinerary and some travelling tips.
Day 1: we arrived in Paris at 10:30pm. Due to hubby work schedule, we didn’t buy the red eye flight ticket, which you will arrive in Paris in the morning, giving you extra time to explore Paris. 
Day 2-3: We explored Paris iconic attractions such as Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Seine River, Montmatre. Because we will be traveling to Switzerland for the next ten days so we did not want to do any shopping first. We also tried some iconic French food and desserts such as escargot, foie gras, hot chocolate, creme brûlée and etc.
💡Tip: Do not take metro to Montmartre, the train ride was pretty long and there’s a lot of stairs to climb up and down in the station. I almost gave up visiting that area. Also, Montmatre is a huge area and there’s a lot of slopes so please wear comfortable shoes if you want to walk around. 
Day 4: We took a morning train to Zurich HB from Paris Gare De Lyon. Tip 💡Stay at a hotel near the train station. We stayed at 📍Hotel Sleeping Belle Paris. I’m really thankful that we make the choice to stay in this hotel because the departure hall for the train was pretty hard to find and the queue to check in was super long. FYI, the train leaves the station pretty punctual.
Day 4- Day 9: Zurich
We stayed in Zurich for 5 days. Initially we booked a few day tours from Klook, so that we did not need to spend too much on our Swiss travel pass. Since most of the day tours depart from Zurich, we decided to stay here the longest. However, we pretty much regret this decision and I will write it in a separate post of the things that I learned from our Switzerland trip.
📍Places that I explored while in Zurich
✅ Mount Titlis
✅ Mount Rigi 
✅ Lucerne 
✅ Rhine Falls
Sadly, we didn’t manage to visit the famous Lindt chocolate museum as I forgot to pre book the tickets early 🥲 I highly recommend to book the tickets at least 2 weeks in advance.
Day 9-11: Interlaken
we stayed in Interlaken for 2 nights as our base for visiting Grindelwald and for paragliding. Unfortunately, it was snowing during our stay at Switzerland so hubby and I eventually skipped paragliding.
We stayed at Interlaken ost (aka Interlaken east) which I highly recommend. We stayed at 📍Hotel du lac and I think it’s a pretty nice place to stay at, though the rooms are slightly outdated. There’s a backpacker hostel near the train station which I would like to try in the future. From outside, the building looks really clean and modern.💡Tip: Most of the airbnbs are located at Interlaken west, which is around 15mins walk by foot from the train station. Alternatively, you can take a bus but it isn’t on a pretty frequent basis and usually it’s really crowded. 
Personally, I feel Interlaken west is slightly crowded. There were lot of tourists when I went. The area mostly are souvenirs shops, restaurants and some luxury shops. There are a few supermarkets, but are pretty small in size and nothing much to buy compared to the coop supermarket near the train station.
📍Places that I visited during my stay in Interlaken
✅ Grindelwald 
✅ Jungfraujoch
✅ Harder Kulm
There were a few places that I would love to explore but I was short of time such as lake blausee and oechinsen lake (the cable car was closed for maintenance and only accessible via hiking so….nah 😂) and aare gorge. I would visit Interlaken again and probably stayed there for 3-4 nights. 
Day 11-14: Geneva 
Lastly, our Switzerland tour concludes at Geneva. We chose to end our trip here cause it is nearer to Paris. What we love about Geneva is there’s a lot of shopping you can do and attractions you can visit plus the buildings and scenery are much prettier in my opinion as compared to Zurich. 
📍Places we visited in Geneva
✅ Parc Le Grange
✅ Jet de Eau
✅ Flower clock
✅ Place la eaux vives.
Day 14-16: Paris
Finally, at the end of our trip we decided to opt for some shopping and visiting Disneyland. For our first two nights we decided to stay at Val d Europe, where you can find the La Vallee Village premium outlet and also Disneyland.💡Tip: do not stay at Val d Europe. We were really disappointed with the premium outlets. Most outlets have limited items to sell. The shopping mall was as disappointing as the outlet and the stores closes really early. I was really disappointed with our stay because we could have visited more places staying at the city area. From Val d Europe to the city is a 1 hour train journey so by the time we reached the city, there isnt much time left for us to shop around for that day For our future trip, I will definitely just book a shuttle ride to Disneyland and stay near the city area.
📍Places that we visited during our stay in Paris 
✅ Printemps 
✅ Galeries Lafayette 
✅ La Samaritane 
✅ Disneyland
✅ Saint Germain Prais 
✅ CityPharma
✅ Champ Elysee
❌ Le Bon Marche
❌ La Vallee Village
Day 16-17: Singapore 
We booked a night flight back to Singapore which gives us extra time for our shopping. Here are some airport tips when you exit Paris. Our airlines is located at Paris CDG Airport Terminal 1
💡The tax refund counter is located one floor down the check in counters and beside departure rows 5-6 (if I remember correctly). It is pretty hidden away and the directions weren’t really clear so do allow some time to find the counter and machine.
💡The tax refund process is pretty straightforward. We used the machine only to process our refunds. First machine (blue) to validate our receipts. Then we went to the second machine (white) which is in another area behind the blue machine, to receive our cash refund. You don’t need to show the immigration customs your items unless you aren’t able to validate your receipts then you will need to proceed to the manual counter.
💡You can process and receive your tax refund at Printemps basement. You might want to validate that tax refund receipt (the blue machine) at the airport. 
💡The security screening of your items can take a while. We waited around 30mins. So do include that time in your time allowance.
💡Eat before you proceed for security checking and boarding. There are more dining options outside than inside the waiting room. I will suggest after processing your tax refunds, just have a quick dinner at any of the restaurants before checking in your luggage and proceed for security checking.
💡Singapore Airlines bag drop counter opens 3 hours before departure. 
Thanks for reading so far and wish you all a great weekend ahead!
