# TRAVEL TIPS IN PARIS
üìå 3 Tips for Traveling to PARIS 
1. BECAREFUL OF PICKPOCKETS 
its almost everywhere in paris. Just becareful with your bags & your wallet whenever you wanna make payments. There will always be someone eyeing on you. 
The moment we arrived in paris & heading to the train station. Someone already following us. The moment we get into the train , local was asking us about direction. 
We were speechless bc they are speaking in their own language & something fishy is going on. 
Theres two girls who approached us. 
one asking us the direction to distract us & another us is just checking for blindspot to put their hands in our bag. 
Thankfully my best friend bag have a ziplock so its difficult for them to take anything from our bag. 
When we realised their hands are in his bag, we pull the bag towards us & they walked away. Its a sign that their mission failed. 
!!! TIPS ALWAYS ZIP UR BAG & IF ITS WINTER THE BEST BC YOU CAN PUT YOUR BAGS INSIDE YOUR JACKET SO THEY CANT SEE WHERES YOUR BAG AT 
2. 
ALWAYS SAY HELLO TO THEM & ACKNOWLEDGE TO RECIEVED GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THEM.
The moment you‚Äôre rude to them especially at the luxury boutique they will ignore you the moment you enter the shop till you ask them for their help. 
They wont give you their best, bc to them the moment you‚Äôre snobbish to them, they wont give their great service to you. 
but if you‚Äôre nice to them, trust me its super worth it . They will allow you to try on their bags, they will bring water for you & also they dont mind you asking multiple questions 
3. Avoid peak hours especially if you‚Äôre taking public transport. 
Its around 6-7pm On weekday we cant even board the train after waiting for 4-5 train. At the end of the day we took uber to our hotel which cost us $19 sgd eventho its just 1 stop away. Their uber is very easy to get but‚Ä¶ 
for experience i would recommend you guys to take the train & walk. During winter period its a nice whether to walk around paris. 
So if you‚Äôre planning to take the train avoid those timings. 
I will share with u all what i did for my 5D4N in paris in the next post üíì
