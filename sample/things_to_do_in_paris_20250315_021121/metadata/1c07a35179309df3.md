# I broke up, what‚Äôs next?
Almost embarrassing, but yes I just broke up! Wouldn‚Äôt be my proudest moment but my ‚Äúseemingly smooth-sailing‚Äù relationship have come to an end after a little less than 8 months. I always believed the saying of ‚Äúthe third one‚Äù, not sure if anyone have heard of this but apparently the third guy that you meet is usually the right one? I thought this was the case but unfortunately it fell through again - and yes! It‚Äôs my 3rd relationship coming of 26 years of age. 
I wouldn‚Äôt delve too much into the context of why and how, but I‚Äôd say that TLDR; compatibility, communication and perhaps difference in life phases have contributed to it. And in all honestly, we both have areas to grow and develop further in how we handle conflicts better but y‚Äôknow- we learn, we grow and it is what it is. 
I‚Äôm still really digesting and trying to come to terms into how things played out, but I know most importantly when managing a break up- it is SUPER IMPORTANT to have a plan and strategy. All too often we let our emotions lead us to dark places after a break up and that‚Äôs totally okay, in fact I feel that having a big big cry is one of the best ways to release all of the anxiety and it‚Äôs the first step to feeling better. But it‚Äôs weird that this time round, perhaps because it isn‚Äôt my first relationship anymore and I‚Äôm abit more experienced (lmao), no tears shed and I‚Äôm actually feeling more relieved and quite ready to move on. It‚Äôs still important to have a proper mindset to do so!
My 4 plan of attack is basically:
‚úîÔ∏è closure - to reflect and understand how things ended up like this, journaling down what went wrong and what I learn from this. Coming to terms that I‚Äôm not the victim nor the perpetrator here. A break up can be mutual with nobody being the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù. Sometimes it‚Äôs really just fundamental differences that cannot be resolved and that‚Äôs ok! 
‚úîÔ∏è cut contact - you like it or not, staying in contact and having loose threads hanging is probably the worst thing you can do during a break up. You really don‚Äôt want to be watching your Ex‚Äôs stories eating ramen with his friends and giving you any opportunity to even reminisce anything. Cut cut cut it all, even if you have to block em, do it for your own good if not you might just end up crawling back and hating yourself for that haha (been there done that) one thing I did this time‚Ä¶ scroll to the last photo. I set it as my wallpaper LOL. Tell me I‚Äôm not the only one who does this‚Ä¶.
‚úîÔ∏è me time - my favourite. WHAT BEATS A NICE distraction?! With the capacity and resources to do so, I‚Äôm going to divert all of my energy to planning my first ever 21 days Europe trip. Would I rather be sipping coffeee by the Eiffel Tower? Or would I allow my mind to turmoil while crying on my bed? I‚Äôll take the Eiffel Tower please. Taking your mind off things and distracting yourself, getting some eat pray love overseas just sounds like too good of a solution to all these. Coming back as a refreshed person; and I believe solo travelling really helps to build a lot of independence that I lost during a relationship and a lot of character.
‚úîÔ∏è: support system GAHHH do I need to say more?! Get all your girl gang and bitch about everything under the sun. Trust me, my girls will be my best vomit bin and a critical step to moving on. Be careful to always ask and make sure you‚Äôre not giving your friends too much negative energy?? Imagine if your friends are also going through a tough time and here I am vomitting my negative energy. Just be respectful of their energy too!!!!
WELL, I GUESS ITS A NEW CHAPTER. Send me some love please HAHAHA‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
