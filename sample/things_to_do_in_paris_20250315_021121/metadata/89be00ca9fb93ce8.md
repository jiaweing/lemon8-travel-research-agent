# places worth eating in Parisü§§ (michelin star etc)
I visited Paris back in September this year and went to these restaurants that are either frequented by locals or popular onlineü§ç
1. Kodawari Ramen Tsukiji
This is a Michelin Star Japanese restaurant which sells ramen mainly with seafood (seafood broth & toppings etc)!! It‚Äôs concept is a fish market so you‚Äôll see the staff dressed as fish mongers and the interior decorated with fake ice boxes, wooden crates etc!! Really felt like I teleported to Japan for a moment hehe <3 I recommend the getting the Edamame and Creamy Broth Ramen here!! I can really taste the rich taste of the broth and understand why it got a Michelin Star.
Do approach the staff for help with queuing as it‚Äôs based on an online queue service which is difficult to use if you don‚Äôt have a local number!! You may have to queue from 30-50 minutes!!
Location: 12 Rue de Richelieu, 75001 Paris, France
2. Le Relais De L‚ÄôEntrec√¥te
THIS IS THE FAMOUS STEAK & FRIES PLACE!!! It lived up to its hype yallüò≠ü´∂üèª They split the mains into 2 rounds but each round has a big serving so‚Ä¶I recommend coming with an empty stomachüòÄ Their signature sauce is so addictive!!! Be prepared to queue for 45-60 minutes though :/ Locals still dine in with their family despite it being a tourist hotspot so this shows how good it is!!
Location: 15 Rue Marbeuf, 75008 Paris, France
3. L‚Äôas Du Fallafel
Falafels are known to be really good in France and this shop is the most famous for their falafels!! The portion of the sandwich is HUGE and they are very generous with the amount of ingredients. Queue may be long but they work fast so you‚Äôll get to eat in no time. The price is also cheap for it so it‚Äôs really worth!! Though, I was kinda disappointed in the bun as it wasn‚Äôt really nice‚Ä¶I used the fork to finish everything inside instead!
Location: 34 Rue des Rosiers, 75004 Paris, France
4. Breizh Cafe
A really good cr√™pe placeüò© Locals frequent here too!! Both savoury & sweet cr√™pes are delicious here so a tip would be for your group to order different types of cr√™pes and share to try each of it!! They have different branches around Paris but according to my sister & her fianc√© who tried the other branches, this branch served the best cr√™pes!
Location: 1 Rue de l'Od√©on, 75006 Paris, France
5. Huguette
This bistro has a really lovely vibe & friendly staff!! I enjoyed the food here a lot, especially the vongole pastaüò≠üò≠üò≠ THE BEST VONGOLE I EVER ATE IN MY LIFE!!! The sauce was rich in flavour, the seafood were fresh, and the pasta was cooked perfectlyü´∂üèª Would definitely visit again if I head back to Paris
Location: 81 Rue de Seine, 75006 Paris, France
6. Hardware Soci√©t√©
A Melbourne caf√© located in Montmartre!! Staff is so friendly, they would chat with us with big smiles on their faces. As you know, Paris is known to drink hot coffee only and the iced coffees aren‚Äôt as great. But Hardware Soci√©t√© serves a really great iced coffee (I miss it till this dayü•≤ I went back to get a 2nd cup‚Ä¶) so do try it if you crave for iced coffee!! I also ate my first ever eggplant sandwich here and it was SOOOOO GOOODDDDD!! Portion was so big as well, really really enjoyed my time there ü§ç
Location: 10 Rue Lamarck, 75018 Paris, France
7. JaJa
This restaurant is a local favourite and it‚Äôs always a full house so you should get a reservation!! Lucky us, the boss allowed us to dine in as soon as it opened without a reservation despite it being a booked full houseü´∂üèª Food here is on the pricey side as it‚Äôs semi-fine dining but I assure you, it is WORTH IT. Every dish we got was so delicious and we kept going ‚ÄúMmmm~‚Äù with a smile on our faces!! We were in such a good mood the whole night due to the delicious food here.
Location: 3 Rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie, 75004 Paris, France
