# spend a day in Melbourne, Australia with me!🇦🇺☕️🫧
hi lemonades!🍋
come spend a day with me in Melbourne! If its your first time to melbourne, you can spend a few hours visiting these places in 1 day! 
1️⃣Woolsworth & Chemist Warehouse🛒
As a singaporean, these 2 are a must go in australia🤣 Groceries are so much cheaper here Lol i always get the strawberries bcs where can i find a pack for <$3 in sg??? impossible. and the strawberries always tastes good🍓Chemist warehouse is where you can get supplements and random shit... its giving watsons and guardian😲
2️⃣Free Tram Zone 🚃🚋
Go and experience taking the free tram! My goodness do i love free transport🫶🏻 They're pretty easy to navigate, if you dont know which direction to go, just check google maps to see which is the nearest stop to the place youre going to. You can also download PTV or Tramtracker to check when the tram is coming and see in real time which stop you are at.
3️⃣State Library Victoria📚♟️
Visit this gorgeous library and go to level 6 observation deck. Tbh i dont understand how the people actually get their work done there bcs of the amount of constant traffic and people Haha i wouldnt be able to focus🤣 At the entrance there's 2 giant chess boards and pieces and you can join the fun or observe the serious looks on the people's faces hahah! i used to know how to play chess and was obsessed with it for a while but i forgot about it already.... 
4️⃣AC/DC & Hosier Lanes🚏
Um can i be honest? I dont see the appeal in these IM SORRY. but i visited it cause its touristy lawl i just walked through them once and im done. Also hosier lane was sketch asf. There were random people jamming in a group behind the alley, crazy randos screaming and throwing shit. Although there were many tourist, I was kinda scared yall so i dipped🤣
5️⃣Royal Arcade & The Block Arcade🛍️
I was in awe because these places are so pretty but my goodness i am so uncultured. Since they are historic, these buildings only have 1 level of shops and thats it. I am so used to shopping malls with multiple levels and infinite shops to browse through🤣 So i found them to be less stimulating but they do have a few nice shops to get souvenirs and things like that. 
6️⃣St Paul's Cathedral🔔
I really wanted to go inside the cathedral as i saw many nice pictures of it online but it was already closed by the time i was there🥲 Thats the thing about australia tho... most places close at around 5.30-6pm ish. So plan wisely! 
7️⃣Flinders Station 🚉
Duhhh! The iconic flinders station is a must see. I feel like everythings is nice at night, so wait for the sun to set and see the station in a new light! (pun intended) 
8️⃣B&W photobooth🎞️
The tiktok famous b&w photobooth. I wanted to go the one in Paris but it was far from where I was staying so i didnt get to go! So the melbourne one it is hahaha. I have yet to take a pic here tho cause i didnt have freaking coins but im going to melbourne again so dont fret! Prepare 8 $1 coins first and watch tiktok videos on it first because apparently got no warning and it will just snap pictures LOL dont waste that $8aud!! and to get here, just cross to the flinders station and turn right and walk straight. Its right before Boost and pretty hard to miss haha. Idk why i thought it would be in some secluded place. 
9️⃣Yarra River🏞️
From the entrance of flinders station, turn left and walk straight. A nice place to view the sunset. 
1️⃣0️⃣Cafes & Coffeeshops🍵🍰
When in melbourne, it's a must to visit the cafes! but this time i didnt manage to go the ones i wanted due to time constraint but the next time i assure you i would! I had dinner at Grill'd which is like a healthy burger concept, and then breakfast at Cocobei which was nearby my hotel lol. I passes by a koko black pop up store and had their classic hot chocolate. It was so yums especially in the cold weather and it was so smooth idk how else to describe it. The chocolate taste was also quite unique☕️🍫I wanted to try the gelato from Pidapipó but i was full from dinner and cold asf so i skipped it:-(
Anyways! I plan to visit more places the next time im in melbourne so stay tuned!!!! 🇦🇺🐨
