# #TRAVELTIPS | How to stay safe in Europe
Europe is a region many people dream of travelling to, the beautiful sights/buildings😍 but there are some impt things to note if do you go! 
1. Travel Insurance 🧑🏻‍💼
Always rmb to get the highest insurance tier there is. It might be expensive but it is really for the best. Lots of European countries have the tendency to go on strike & when that happens lots of things can go wrong (missed flights/trains/robbery/injuries) 
I arrived in Paris on the 13th of March, day 7 during the reform strike. My itinerary wasnt affected as transport still ran smoothly besides certain stations being closed but airport immigration was a heckin mess. If i arrived a week earlier i would have been affected by the parades & transport disruptions
Airport immigration was a mess though, we didnt even pass the baggage check at 10:10am & our flight was at 10:40am🤨😩 this is despite us hving priority access already. My flight was supposed to be full but there were empty seats probably cause others missed it
2. Prepare extra $$ for unexpected changes 💸
In event of a strike, big disruptions such as airport shutdown might happen & you will miss your flight. Always prepare some allowance for additional hotel stays & prepare even more for last min flights, flying from Europe back to SG or Asia can cost a bomb (at least 6/7k economy on SQ)
3. Liasensing w your boarder/babysitter/caretaker 👯‍♀️
Always ensure that they are able to continue caring for your pet/child/eldery for a day or two more. If you miss your flight you will be delayed for another day cause of the time difference. 
4 . Pickpockets/scams❌
This is super super common in europe esp in countries like France & Italy. Always carry your bags in front, best would be non flashy bags but still be careful. The pickpockets don't just target designer stuff, they look for anything that gives them an opportunity, so to not catch their attention just dress subtly. 
Scams come in different forms such as petition signatures/games/souveniors. Near tourist attractions such as the Eiffel tower there will always be people who will approach you w a clipboard asking you to sign or if you speak english, just ignore everything. 
You can always find people talking abt these scams on tiktok/youtube, do watch a few to better understand how they do it so you can prepare yourself👍🏻
5. Counterfeit Luggage🧳
Designer luggage such as Rimowa & Tumi are expensive which is why lots of people purchase knock offs. European countries have a stricter policy regarding counterfeit goods so do not bring anyt fake items over. They can fine you for owning one or confiscate it & a whole other problem will arise🙃 
I hope this post helped! Remember to always be careful of your surroundings & you'll be fine! 👍🏻🤩 stay safe!!
